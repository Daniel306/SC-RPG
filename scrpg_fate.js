"Let us tell the tale of a certain man.",
"The tale of a man who believed in his ideals more than anyone else, and by them was driven into despair.",
"His dream was pure.",
"His wish was for everyone in the world to be happy. That was all he wanted.",
"It was a childish ideal. Every young boy grasps for it at least once in his life and lets it go when he acknowledges the harshness of reality.",
"For there to be happiness, there has to be sacrifice. Children learn that when they grow up.",
"But he was different.",
"He might have been more foolish than anyone else. He might have just been broken somewhere. Or he might have been a saint, carrying out the will of God. A person whom the rabble could not hope to understand.",
"He knew that all life on earth had to be weighed either for sacrifice or salvation.",
"After realising that he would never be able to clear the pans…",
"He decided on that day to become the one who would tip the scales.",
"There was no other way, no more efficient method to relieve the world of its grief.",
"To save even a single life on one side meant forsaking one life on the other.",
"To save the many, he had to kill the few.",
"So, instead of saving people for their own sakes, he devoted himself to the art of destroying them.",
"Without flinching once, he painted his hands blood-red again and again.",
"He never questioned the rightness of his actions, nor did he ever doubt his goal. He forced himself to be nothing but an impartial mover of the scales.",
"Never, ever misjudging the value of a life.",
"High or lowly, young or old. All lives were of equal weight.",
"He saved without discriminating and killed without discriminating.",
"It was a pity that he realised the truth too late.",
"To treat everything equally and impartially means not choosing anyone to love.",
"If he had decided earlier to carve that unchanging rule into his soul, he would have been saved.",
"He froze his young heart to death and reached his goal, becoming a weighing machine with neither blood nor tears. His life became one of sorting. Sorting those who were to die, and sorting those who were to live. There should have been no pain there.",
"But he was wrong.",
"The sight of a delighted smile would still fill his chest with pride. The sound of a wailing voice would still shake his heart to the core.",
"Regret and anger had filled him to the brim. His lonely tears screamed for some hand, any hand to reach out to him.",
"For though he was chasing after an ideal beyond mortal reason, he was, after all, only human.",
"How many times had he been punished for that contradiction?",
"Friendship he had known. Love he knew too.",
"But when he had to place a single beloved life on one pan and an infinite number of perfect strangers on the other, he made no error.",
"It went beyond love. To truly see that one life as equal, he had to treat it like all the others. He had to sacrifice it like all the others.",
"That was why he always mourned when he was with the people he loved.",
"And now, he was suffering his greatest punishment.",
"Everything had been frozen by the winter storm outside the window. In the midwinter night, darkness muffled the forest floor.",
"The room was just one in an old castle, grounds frozen solid – but the gentle flame that burned in the fireplace protected it from the biting cold.",
"In the warmth of that haven, the man cradled a new life in his arms.",
"It was small. A body so tiny as to be ephemeral, with no weight to confirm its existence.",
"A handful of fresh-scooped snow could crumble at the slightest jolt. Just like that, even the most delicate touch might put her in mortal danger.",
"Frail and desperate to maintain her body temperature, the child slept, taking shallow breaths. They were all her weak, throbbing chest could manage.",
"“Don’t worry. She’s just sleeping.”",
"As he lifted the baby in his arms, the new mother smiled at them as she rested on the bed.",
"The woman was still troubled by her child’s haggard look. Her complexion was far from healthy. Yet her face remained as beautiful as a jewel, not dimming in any way.",
"Above all, her joy brightened her smile and erased the exhaustion that should have marred her gentle countenance.",
"“She’s been difficult until now. She even cried when we gave her to the nurses, and she should have gotten used to them at this point. It’s the first time she’s allowed someone to hold her like this… She understands, doesn’t she? That it’s alright because you’re a good man.”",
"“…”",
"He made no reply. Dumbfounded, the man compared the mother in the bed with the child in his arms. Had Irisviel’s smile ever been that dazzling?",
"She had been a woman of little happiness. No-one would have thought of ever giving her that feeling. She had been created not by God, but by the hands of man. It was normal for a homunculus to be treated that way, and Irisviel had never wished otherwise.",
"Created as a doll, brought up as a doll. Perhaps she had never understood the meaning of happiness to begin with.",
"Now, she was beaming.",
"“I’m so glad she was born.”",
"Irisviel von Einzbern quietly expressed her love for the sleeping child.",
"“From now on, she’ll be an imitation of a human before anything else. It might be hard for her, and she might hate the mother who gave her such a painful life. Even then, I’m happy. She’s lovely. Splendid.”",
"Her appearance was nothing too out of the ordinary. She really did look like a lovely baby. And yet -",
"She had been experimented on while still in her mother’s womb. Changed with magical treatments so that she would be even more different from normal humans than her mother was. She had been delivered successfully, but her functions were still limited. Her body would never be more than a mere cluster of Magic Circuits. That was the true nature of Irisviel’s beloved daughter.",
"“It’s fine.” That was what Irisviel had said in spite of the cruelness of such a birth. She had given birth to it. It had been born like that. And yet she still loved that life, took pride in it. Smiled at it.",
"The reason for that strength and open heart was that she was undoubtedly a Mother.",
"The girl who could only ever be a puppet had found love and become a woman. She had found an unshakeable strength as a mother. It seemed a happiness that no-one could penetrate. At that moment, their bedroom, guarded by the warmth of the fireplace, was impervious to all despair and sorrow.",
"But the man knew better. That the world was like the snowstorm outside the window.",
"“Iri, I-”",
"That one word ran his chest through with a blade. That blade was the peaceful face of the sleeping baby and the glowing smile of her mother.",
"“I… I will be the cause of your death.”",
"He felt like blood would spurt up from his lungs at any moment. Irisviel simply gave a peaceful nod in acknowledgement of his words.",
"“I know. It’s the earnest wish of the Einzberns and the very reason I exist.”",
"That was the future that had already been decided.",
"After six years, he had finally taken her to the place where she would die. As the one victim who would die to save the world, Irisviel would become the sacrifice to his ideals.",
"They had discussed it a number of times, and each time they had reached an agreement.",
"He had already cursed himself for it, cried his heart out at that decision. And yet Irisviel had forgiven him and encouraged him every time.",
"“I am who I am now because I learned of your ideals and took your prayers to heart. You’ve guided me. You’ve given me life a mere puppet wouldn’t have.”",
"She had sacrificed herself for the same ideals. In that way, she had become a part of him. It was the same for the object that would hold the love of the woman Irisviel. Because it was her, he would allow it.",
"“You need not pity me. I’m already a part of you. It’s already enough that you must bear your own suffering.”",
"“…What about her, then?”",
"The infant’s body was light as a feather. It was a completely different weight that made his legs shake.",
"He couldn’t understand it yet. He wasn’t prepared for what he would be forced to do when he had to place the child against the ideal he carried.",
"He should neither be judged nor forgiven. The power for that does not yet exist.",
"But even though his heart is pure, his ideals are merciless.",
"Uncaring as to the fortunes of a life, uncaring as to age. All as equal –",
"“I have no right… to hold that child.”",
"The man forced out his words, despite the risk that his happiness might be crushed in insanity.",
"A single tear fell on the plump rosebud cheek of the baby in his arms.",
"Sobbing silently, he fell to one knee.",
"To destroy all the heartlessness of this world, he reached for for a greater heartlessness. But for the man who still had loved ones, that was the greatest punishment of all.",
"The person he loved most in the world.",
"Even if it meant the ruin of everything else, he still wanted to protect her.",
"But he understood. The time would come when his justice would demand the sacrifice of that pure life. What kind of decision would he, Emiya Kiritsugu, make then?",
"Kiritsugu cried. He was scared of the possibility of that day. He was frightened by that chance, that one-in-a-thousand chance.",
"He clasped the tiny chest closer to him. Irisviel raised herself from the bed and placed a gentle hand on her husband’s shoulder. The man who had burst into tears.",
"“Kiritsugu, don’t forget. A world where no-one needs to cry that way… isn’t that your ideal, your dream? Eight more years, and your fight will come to an end. And our ideal will become reality. I’m sure that the Holy Grail will save you.”",
"Fully understanding his agony, Kiritsugu’s wife wiped away the tears as kindly as she could.",
"“So after this day, take this child, Ilyasviel, and hold her. Be proud. Just as any father would.”"
